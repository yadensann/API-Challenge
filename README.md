## WeatherPy
______________________________________________

Created a Python script that calls for 606 different cities across the world and created visual aids comparing the weather and it's distance from the equator.

Made scatter plots and small analysis for each of the following relationships: 
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Separated the data into Northen and Southern Hemispheres and ran linear regression on each scatter plot for each of the following relationships: 
* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
